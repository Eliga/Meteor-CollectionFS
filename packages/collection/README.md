cfs:collection
=========================

This is a Meteor package used by
[CollectionFS](https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS).

You don't need to manually add this package to your app. It is added when you
add the `cfs:standard-packages` package.

Set `FS.enableObserve = true` before creating any collection to enable the FS tempStore observer in your app.
